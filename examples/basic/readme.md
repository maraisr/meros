# Example: Basic

This example demonstrates how to use `meros` reading a multipart response generated by a
[`polka`](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) server.

But really works with any server, put simply; this example shows how `meros` can be used reading a multipart response.

## Getting started

_Setup_

```sh
npm install
```

_Start_

```sh
npm start
```

Running the above command will spin up a [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) client-side bundler wrapped up in a
[`polka`](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) server.

- [_localhost:8080_](http://localhost:8080/) — will run a very simple client-runtime ~ [see client.ts](client.ts)
- [_localhost:8080/data_](http://localhost:8080/data) — responds with our multipart response
